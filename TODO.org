* Conversion to Spreadsheets
This is a [[https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect][gem]] that I can include into the Table model to convert a table into
a spread-sheet, or even a sheet in a multi-sheet spreadsheet file.

* Formatters
Need to think about ways to define formatters for Table for different output
types, including tty, color-tty, latex, csv, spreadsheet?

* Add a Group Boundary concept
If I want a table to perform sub-totals at various break points, need to have a
way for a table to record its grouping boundaries. Maybe an array of row
numbers?  Automatically injected by the group-by method?

* DONE Add uniq method and set operations

  For tables, add a method that eliminates any duplicate rows. Perhaps just
  apply Array#uniq to the columns?
