  # The Evaluator class provides a class for evaluating Ruby expressions based
  # on variable settings provided at runtime. If the same Evaluator object is
  # used for several successive calls, it can maintain state between calls with
  # instance variables. The call to Evaluator.new can be given a hash of
  # instance variable names and values that will be maintained across all calls
  # to the #evaluate method. In addition, on each evaluate call, a set of
  # /local/ variables can be supplied to provide variables that exist only for
  # the duration of that evaluate call. An optional before and after string can
  # be given to the constructor that will evaluate the given expression before
  # and, respectively, after each call to #evaluate. This provides a way to
  # update values of instance variables for use in subsequent calls to
  # #evaluate.
